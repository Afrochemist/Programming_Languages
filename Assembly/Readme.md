# Assembly Languages.

# Giving support/help
These projects very clearly explain you some of the basics for the Assembly programming languages, and briefly covers all major topics for the beginners. These projects are made to help the understanding of the code for beginners that are practicing. If you want to contribute with this little "hobbie project", simply do a issue report about the syntax if there's a mistake, or do a pull request about new functions. NOTE: If you have to add stuff for assembly, make the folders inside the Assembly folder  like chapters based on the functions you want to use, see C folder for an example.

Thank you!!

Happy coding!!
