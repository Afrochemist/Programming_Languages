# C-Programming
Sharing very basic projects made in CodeBlocks to help the understanding of the code for beginners that are practicing, like me.

# Giving support/help
If you want to contribute with this little "hobbie project", simply do a issue report about the syntax if there are any problems.
Or you can give tips too about it.
