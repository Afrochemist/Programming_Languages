These projects very clearly expalin you some of the bascis of known programming, and briefly covers all major topics for the beginners. These projects are made to help the understanding of the code for beginners that are practicing. If you want to contribute with this little "hobbie project", simply do a issue report about the syntax if there a mistake, or do a pull request about new functions.

Currently working on: C, C++, Python.
